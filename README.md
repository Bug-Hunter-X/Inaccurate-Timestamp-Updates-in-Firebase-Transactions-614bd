# Inaccurate Timestamp Updates in Firebase Transactions
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Firebase Firestore when using server timestamps within transactions. The issue arises from the way server timestamps are handled internally, which may lead to inaccurate update times.

## Problem Description
The provided JavaScript code attempts to update a document's timestamp using `firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` inside a transaction. However, there's a potential for the updated timestamp to not precisely reflect the transaction's commit time due to internal server processing delays.

## Solution
The solution involves strategically using the serverTimestamp and carefully handling potential conflicts and race conditions. This might involve using a combination of optimistic concurrency control techniques or additional data management to ensure consistency.
